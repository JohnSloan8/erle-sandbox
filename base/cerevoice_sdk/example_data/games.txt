Speech Synthesis and Dynamic Game Conversations: Imagine if the game
 could assess a situation based on a long series of relevant player
 inputs, string together some responses and construct a convincing
 verbal response using a speech synthesis system. Suddenly, vastly more
 interactivity is possible. Once again, instead of a few canned
 responses (provided by the designer), the game could allow for a much
 wider range of responses, games might someday be able to analyze voice
 input and formulate a conversation that never had to be written by a
 designer, a conversation of much greater relevance to the player's
 actions. (And when speech synthesis is combined with true artificial
 intelligence, narrative games will finally become truly interactive.)
