<prosody pitch="high">Speech Synthesis</prosody> and Dynamic Game Conversations: Imagine if the game
 could assess a situation based on a long series of relevant player
 inputs, string together some responses and construct a convincing
 verbal response using a speech synthesis system. Suddenly, vastly more
 interactivity is possible. Once again, instead of a few canned
 responses (provided by the designer), the game could allow for a much
 wider range of responses, games might someday be able to analyze voice
 input and formulate a conversation that never had to be written by a
 designer a conversation of much greater relevance to the player's
 actions. (<usel variant="1">And</usel> when speech synthesis is combined with true artificial
 intelligence, narrative games will finally become truly interactive.)
